# Bring Your Own Token Contract

Token creators who would like to use their own token contract functionality can inherit `ERC721SeaDrop`, or for Owner and Administrator roles `ERC721PartnerSeaDrop`. There are also several extensions in `src/extensions` such as Burnable and RandomOffset.

SeaDrop tokens use ERC721A for efficient multiple-quantity mint, along with additional tracking metadata like number of tokens minted by address used for enforcing wallet limits. Please do not override or modify any SeaDrop-related functionality on the token like `getMintStats()` to remain compatible and secure with SeaDrop.

For deploy steps, see [SeaDrop Token Deployment](./SeaDropTokenDeployment.md).
